## ✨ New Features
- **Poll Voting Overhaul**
  - Users can now change their votes for multiple-choice polls.
  - Single-choice polls now allow selecting a different option before submitting.
  - Poll creators can now edit polls: add/remove options, extend the end date, or allow users to submit their own options.
  - Polls dynamically update results and pre-select previously voted options.

- **User-Submitted Poll Options**
  - If `allowUserOptions` is enabled, users can add new options to active polls before voting.

- **DB Health Check Middleware**
  - Middleware checks the health of the database before allowing page access.
  - If the database is down, users are redirected to a `/loading` page.
  - The `/loading` page pings `/api/check-db` every 10 seconds until the DB is healthy, then redirects back to `/`.

## 🛠 Improvements
- Fixed `Invalid hook call` from `useTheme()` by restructuring `ToasterProvider` under `ThemeProvider`.
- Cleaned up poll result UI — results display inline and highlight selected options.
- Middleware avoids redundant DB checks for static assets and unprotected routes.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed error logging for failed DB checks (`payload must be object` error).
- Ensured `votePoll()` properly skips duplicate votes and handles user-submitted options cleanly.

March 27th, 2025
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `withDbReady` utility function to guard server actions against database unavailability.
- Ensures a consistent check using `globalThis.dbConnected` before executing any Prisma action.

### Changed
- Updated all server actions to use `withDbReady()` instead of manually calling `ensureDbReady()`.
- Improved server resilience and user experience by preventing calls to the database when the server is starting or down.
fix: prevent build-time DB access by forcing dynamic rendering on /friends /admin /birthdays /events /profile

- Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to pages that rely on runtime DB access
- Prevents static rendering errors during build when the database is not yet connected
- Affected pages: /friends, /admin, /birthdays, /events, /profile

### Changed
- Refactored `ensureDbReady` to redirect users to `/loading` instead of throwing an error when the database is not ready.
- Improves user experience by preventing crashes and providing a smoother transition during server startup.

## 🛠️ Fix: Database Health Check Cookie

- Resolved `Property 'set' does not exist on type 'Promise<ReadonlyRequestCookies>'` error
- Added `await` before `cookies()` in `/api/check-db` route to ensure proper cookie handling
- Set `dbConnected` cookie to `"true"` or `"false"` with 60s lifetime
- Improved stability and diagnostics for DB connection tracking

```ts
const cookieStore = await cookies();
cookieStore.set("dbConnected", "true", { path: "/", maxAge: 60 });



#### 🔧 Updated `<ClientComponent />`
- **Before:** `Link href="www.havens-heroes.com/contact"`
- **After:** `Link href="/contact"`  
  🔹 Fixed incorrect external URL to use internal Next.js routing.

#### 📱 Updated `<MobileMenu />` component
- Added `/contact` link to the mobile navigation dropdown.
- Ensured all routes use proper `Link` components for internal navigation:
  - `/` → Home
  - `/friends` → Friends
  - `/contact` → Contact

### 📅 2025-03-31

#### 🗳️ Updated `<PollDisplayMultiple />` and backend vote handling

- 🛡️ Enforced **one vote per user per option** at the database level using Prisma `@@unique` constraint on `(poll_id, option_id, user_id)`.
- 🔁 Fixed issue where unchecking a selected poll option did not correctly update votes.
- ❌ Removed automatic addition of "Unable to attend any of the dates" on poll display—this is now added during poll creation.
- 🔧 Updated Prisma schema:
  - Added missing relation fields for `poll.pollvotes` and `pollvote.poll`.
  - Ensured schema is valid and migratable.
- 🧹 Added cleanup query instructions to remove duplicate votes before applying the unique constraint.

### 🗓️ **Changelog (2025-03-31)**

#### 🛠 Schema Update: Post ↔ poll Relation
- **Added bidirectional relation between `Post` and `poll` models**:
  - **Post model**: added `poll` field with named relation `@relation("PostPoll")`
  - **poll model**: added `post` field with matching named relation `@relation("PostPoll", fields: [post_id], references: [id])`
- ✅ This allows Prisma to include poll data in `getAllPosts()` and other queries referencing posts with polls.

## ✨ Features Added
- Integrated a new `PollActionsDropdown` component into `PollDisplayMultiple` to allow poll owners to manage their polls.
  - Buttons include:
    - End Poll
    - Delete Poll
    - Clear Votes
    - (Planned) Edit Poll and Delete Option
- Dropdown only appears if the logged-in user is the poll's creator (`isOwner`).

## 🛠 Refactoring
- Adjusted layout of `PollDisplayMultiple` to include a flex container at the top-right for the actions menu.
- Passed `poll.user_id === userId` as `isOwner` to conditionally show the actions.

## 💄 UI Enhancements
- Positioned the `PollActionsDropdown` in the top right using `flex justify-end w-full` for better UX and visibility.

## 📌 Notes
- Next steps:
  - Add functionality for editing question/options.
  - Finalize admin permission support.
  - Extend to `PollDisplay` for single-vote polls.
