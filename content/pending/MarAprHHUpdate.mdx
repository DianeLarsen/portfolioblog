## ‚ú® New Features
- **Poll Voting Overhaul**
  - Users can now change their votes for multiple-choice polls.
  - Single-choice polls now allow selecting a different option before submitting.
  - Poll creators can now edit polls: add/remove options, extend the end date, or allow users to submit their own options.
  - Polls dynamically update results and pre-select previously voted options.

- **User-Submitted Poll Options**
  - If `allowUserOptions` is enabled, users can add new options to active polls before voting.

- **DB Health Check Middleware**
  - Middleware checks the health of the database before allowing page access.
  - If the database is down, users are redirected to a `/loading` page.
  - The `/loading` page pings `/api/check-db` every 10 seconds until the DB is healthy, then redirects back to `/`.

## üõ† Improvements
- Fixed `Invalid hook call` from `useTheme()` by restructuring `ToasterProvider` under `ThemeProvider`.
- Cleaned up poll result UI ‚Äî results display inline and highlight selected options.
- Middleware avoids redundant DB checks for static assets and unprotected routes.

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed error logging for failed DB checks (`payload must be object` error).
- Ensured `votePoll()` properly skips duplicate votes and handles user-submitted options cleanly.
