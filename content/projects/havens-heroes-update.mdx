# Building Haven's Heroes: Progress, Challenges, and Lessons Learned

Over the past few weeks, I have been working on **Haven's Heroes**, a web platform that integrates authentication, user interactions, and event management. This post highlights the key milestones, challenges faced, and solutions implemented along the way.

---

## **üöÄ Progress So Far**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Project & Authentication**
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (App Router), Prisma, Supabase, Clerk (for authentication), Brevo (for emails), and Vercel for deployment.
- **Authentication**: Implemented user authentication using Clerk, ensuring a seamless login/signup experience with email/password and social sign-ins.
- **Database Management**: Connected to Supabase to store user data and interactions.
- **Hosting**: Deployed the site on Vercel, ensuring smooth and reliable performance.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancing User Experience**
- **UI Improvements**: Redesigned the home page to be more welcoming, with proper theme support using Next-Themes.
- **Navigation & Menus**: Implemented a left-side menu for signed-in users and a clean layout for visitors.
- **Activity Feed**: Built a structured list of recent activities like new posts, stories, and interactions.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling & Logging**
- **Database Error Logging**: Created an `errorLogs` table in Supabase to store issues that occur in production.
- **Email Alerts**: Integrated Brevo to send notifications when critical errors occur (e.g., missing user data after login).
- **User Feedback**: Added a message prompt when something fails, suggesting a refresh or contacting support.

## **üî• Challenges & How I Overcame Them**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prisma Not Recognizing the New `errorLogs` Table**
‚ùå **Issue:** After manually creating the `errorLogs` table in Supabase, Prisma didn‚Äôt recognize it.

‚úÖ **Solution:**
1. **Ran Prisma's database pull to sync the schema:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db pull
   ```
2. **Regenerated the Prisma client:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```
3. **Checked `schema.prisma` and added the correct model mapping:**
   ```prisma
   model errorLogs {
     id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     message   String
     details   String?
     createdAt DateTime @default(now())
     @@map("errorLogs") // Ensures Prisma recognizes it properly
   }
   ```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Database URL Not Found When Running Prisma Commands**
‚ùå **Issue:** Prisma threw an error **"Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL"** when running `npx prisma db pull`.

‚úÖ **Solution:**
- Ensured `.env.local` was properly loaded:
  ```bash
  npx dotenv -e .env.local -- prisma db pull
  ```
- Verified `DATABASE_URL` was accessible:
  ```bash
  echo $DATABASE_URL
  ```
- Renamed `.env.local` to `.env` temporarily to force Prisma to load it.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ User Data Not Showing in Production**
‚ùå **Issue:** User data appeared in Supabase but wasn‚Äôt being retrieved in production.

‚úÖ **Solution:**
- **Confirmed Clerk & Supabase Were Using the Same Database** by ensuring `DATABASE_URL` was the same for both dev and prod.
- **Added a Case-Sensitivity Fix** for Prisma since PostgreSQL treats `"User"` differently than `user`:
  ```prisma
  model User {
    id       String  @id
    username String  @unique
    @@map("User") // Fixes case sensitivity
  }
  ```
- **Re-ran Prisma Sync:**
  ```bash
  npx prisma db pull && npx prisma generate
  ```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Brevo Email Not Sending Properly**
‚ùå **Issue:** Emails weren‚Äôt being sent due to an incorrect API client setup.

‚úÖ **Solution:**
- Used the correct API authentication method:
  ```ts
  import SibApiV3Sdk from "sib-api-v3-sdk";
  
  const brevoClient = new SibApiV3Sdk.TransactionalEmailsApi();
  const apiInstance = SibApiV3Sdk.ApiClient.instance;
  const apiKey = apiInstance.authentications["api-key"];
  apiKey.apiKey = process.env.BREVO_API_KEY;
  ```
- Tested sending emails manually to verify the fix:
  ```ts
  await sendEmail({
    to: "admin@havens-heroes.com",
    subject: "Test Email",
    body: "This is a test email from Haven's Heroes."
  });
  ```

## **üéØ Next Steps**
‚úÖ **Finalize User Profiles** - Improve UI and profile customization.
‚úÖ **Enhance Notifications** - Implement in-app notifications for events, polls, and activity updates.
‚úÖ **Integrate Google Calendar** - Allow users to sync event registrations.
‚úÖ **Implement Invite-Only Access** - Restrict sign-ups once the site is fully functional.

üöÄ **Haven's Heroes is coming together!** Excited for the next phase. Stay tuned for more updates!
