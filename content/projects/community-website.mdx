Woods Creek View is a community bulletin board website I built to improve neighborhood communication and collaboration. The journey of creating this site has been both challenging and rewarding, as I’ve worked to balance functionality, design, and usability.

## What I’ve Done So Far

When I started Woods Creek View, I wanted to create a space where neighbors could share events, post announcements, and organize resources in a way that was accessible to everyone. Here are the key milestones I’ve achieved so far:

- **Core Features**: The site currently supports event posting, a bulletin board for announcements, and a resource-sharing section for tools and equipment.  
- **User Authentication**: I implemented a login system to ensure that only verified users can post and interact with the site. While functional, it still needs some refinement.  
- **Database Integration**: I chose PostgreSQL for the backend database to store user accounts, posts, and event details.  
- **Responsive Design**: Using Tailwind CSS, I ensured that the site works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
- **Deployment**: The site is hosted on Vercel, making it easy to access at [woodscreekview.com](https://woodscreekview.com).  

Developing these features required a lot of trial and error, especially in building the database schema and designing a user-friendly interface. The process taught me the importance of balancing simplicity with functionality.

## Challenges Along the Way

Creating Woods Creek View hasn’t been without its challenges:

1. **Authentication**: While the authentication system works, it’s not as polished as I’d like. Features like password recovery and two-factor authentication need improvement.  
2. **Email Notifications**: Setting up email alerts for new events and posts has been tricky. The system works but requires fine-tuning to make it more reliable and user-friendly.  
3. **Smooth User Experience**: I’ve worked hard on the UI, but there are areas where the experience could be smoother. For example, improving the speed of loading posts and refining the navigation structure are on my to-do list.

## What’s Next

There’s still a lot I’d like to do to enhance Woods Creek View. Some of my immediate goals include:

- **Refining Authentication**: I plan to improve the user login system, add email-based verification, and make the overall authentication process more seamless.  
- **Improving Email Settings**: The email system needs adjustments to ensure timely and accurate notifications.  
- **Performance Enhancements**: I want to optimize the site for faster load times and a smoother experience.  
- **Upgrading to Next.js 15**: Currently, the site is built on an earlier version of Next.js. Updating to the latest version will allow me to take advantage of new features and improve maintainability.

## Reflection

Looking back, I’m proud of how far Woods Creek View has come. From an initial idea to a fully functional website, this project has been a labor of love and a chance to learn new skills. It’s far from perfect, but it’s a strong foundation for what I hope will become a valuable resource for my community.
