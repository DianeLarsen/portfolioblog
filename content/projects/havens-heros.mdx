# Haven's Heroes Website

## Project Overview

Haven's Heroes is a private website designed for a close-knit group of friends who enjoy board games, attending comic conventions, and sharing fun moments. The site will serve as a digital hub for the group, fostering communication, coordination, and camaraderie. Inspired by the group's shared D&D campaign, the site is invite-only and will reflect the spirit of friendship and creativity.

3. **Polls and Events**
   - Ability to create polls for group decisions.
   - Event creation and management, including RSVP functionality.
   - Notifications and reminders for upcoming events.

- **State Management**:
  - **Zustand** or **Redux** for managing global state, particularly for user sessions, posts, and events.
- **Calendar**:

### Optional Tools
- **File Uploads**: Use services like Cloudinary or AWS S3 for profile pictures and post attachments.

- **Newsletter Management**: Use **Mailchimp API** or **Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)** for email newsletters.
